# Mission-to-Mars

*Note: This repository was generated to fulfill assignments (Module 10 Exercises and Challenge) for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Content and code were based on the module instructions and grading rubric.*


## Summary Overview
This project demonstrates some basic skills in web scraping and building a web app using FLASK. Information about Mars was scraped from various sources and stored as unstructured data in a mongo database. BeautifulSoup was used to parse html text. FLASK was used to create a web app to display all stored information and scraping was automated using a script linked to the app and html button.

Figure 1 below displays the webpage with information scraped on 2-25-22.
